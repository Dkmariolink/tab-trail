# D3.js Library

This directory should contain the D3.js library file. Due to size constraints, it's not included in the repository.

## Download Required

Before running the extension, download D3.js v7:

```bash
curl -o d3.v7.min.js https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js
```

Or manually download from: https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js

## Required File

- `d3.v7.min.js` - D3.js version 7 minified library

The extension will not work without this file!
